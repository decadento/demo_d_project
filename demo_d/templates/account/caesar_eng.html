                <p>The CAESAR (CAmion Equipé d'un Système d'ARtillerie), French for "truck equipped with an artillery system", is a wheeled 155mm self-propelled howitzer developed in France by arms manufacturer GIAT Industries, now known as Nexter. Self-propelled guns are designed to destroy the enemy's manpower, artillery, fortifications and other equipment.      </p>

                <p>The artillery installation is equipped with a modernized version of the 155-mm TRF1 gun with a barrel length of 52 calibers, mounted in the rear part of the wheeled chassis. Transportable ammunition - 18 shells. Rate of fire - 6 shots per minute. CAESAR is capable of using the entire range of NATO 155-mm artillery shells, including high-precision GPS-type Excalibur or Vulcano.  </p>
                
                <p>As the chassis of the self-propelled guns for the French army, the Renault Sherpa 5 with a wheel formula of 6x6 is used, which has an armored cabin that protects the gun crew of 5 soldiers from shell fragments and shelling with 7.62 mm bullets. There is an air conditioning system. The weight of the installation is about 18 tons, the length is 10 m, the width is 2.55 m.         </p>

                <p>CAESAR self-propelled guns are equipped with navigation devices, aiming devices and communication systems. The artillery installation uses the SIGMA 30 fire control system, which includes a receiver of the NAVSTAR navigation system, a radar for measuring the initial velocity of the projectile and a built-in ballistic calculator. The ACS is also equipped with a mechanized projectile delivery system.    </p>

                <p>CAESAR was created to replace the TRF1 trailed howitzers in the French army, and later the AUF1 self-propelled guns. The first sample of the new ACS was shown in 1994. In 2000, a contract was signed for the supply of five pre-production units on the Mercedes-Benz Unimog U2450L (6x6) chassis to the French army. Self-propelled guns were used for familiarization with the new artillery system and for experimental operation in the troops.       </p>

Serial production of new self-propelled guns was established in 2007. But at the request of the customer, the artillery system can be integrated on different chassis.  </p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">CAESAR in Ukraine</h2>


                <p>On April 22, 2022, it became known about the transfer of CAESAR self-propelled guns to Ukraine as part of military aid from France. At that time, President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview that he supplies Ukraine with a variety of weapons "from Milans (Milan ATGMs - "Military") to Caesars" and plans to do so in the future. Ukrainian gunners were trained on them.   </p>

                <p>And already in May it became known that the French CAESAR wheeled 155-mm self-propelled artillery installations are already on the territory of Ukraine and are being used against the Russian invaders.</p>

                <p>The Ukrainian military also showed photos of crews and provided foreign self-propelled guns, which are already in use on the front lines.              </p>

                <p>Already in the summer, Ukrainian gunners showed journalists how the control system of CAESAR self-propelled guns works, which fired at targets in the rear of Russian troops in Donbas.           </p>
                <p>The military emphasized that one of the main advantages of self-propelled guns is a digital fire control system, which allows you to fire almost immediately after occupying a position.         </p>

                <p>Gunners can enter the coordinates of the target while moving into position, and the system does everything by itself.  </p>
                <p>Artilleryman Gleb said that the task of the crew is only to enter the coordinates. "I can do it at least while advancing to the position, and the system will already calculate all the necessary data for hitting the target."               </p>

                <p>The military also added that after all the calculations, the required ammunition is selected. CAESAR self-propelled artillery can complete a combat mission in 3-5 minutes. This time includes taking up the firing position and opening fire.       </p>

                <p>Ukraine received several batches of CAESAR from France in 2022-2023. Artillery installations demonstrated high efficiency on the battlefield with the Russian invaders. Ukraine also received 19 self-propelled howitzers, but on the Tatra 815-7 8x8 chassis from Denmark.    </p>

                <p>The French defense company Nexter has increased the pace of production of CAESAR self-propelled guns. The production cycle was cut in half: from 30 to 15 months.             </p>
                <p>In January 2024, the French Minister of Defense Sebastien Lecornu assured that the increased pace of production will make it possible to release almost 80 artillery installations in 2024. This will become possible thanks to the reduction of the production cycle of one ACS from 30 to 15 months. In addition, the Nexter manufacturer was able to create the necessary stocks and hire additional workers.         </p>

                <p>In addition, the Franco-German defense company KNDS, which includes Nexter, predicted an increase in demand for CAESAR self-propelled guns.

                <p>The initiative aims to provide the Ukrainian Armed Forces with artillery weapons in the short and long term. Weapons are necessary to strengthen resistance to Russian aggression.

                <p>Within the framework of the project, it is planned to purchase 78 CAESAR artillery installations for Ukraine, which should be manufactured in 2024. It is assumed that each of the countries participating in the coalition will contribute to the financing of the project. Thus, France will use 50 million euros from its Ukraine Support Fund to order 12 of the 78 howitzers. Production of 6 more self-propelled guns was financed by Ukraine.              </p>
