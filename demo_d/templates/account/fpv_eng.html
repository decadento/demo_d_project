                <p>Successful use of one or more cheap drones can destroy equipment worth millions of dollars. This is evidenced by many videos of the combat use of such drones at the front.</p>
                
                
                
                

                <p>Let's consider what is the peculiarity of FPV drones and their combat capabilities for defeating equipment and manpower.</p>

                <p>FPV drones are a type of drones that are controlled using the "first person view" function (in English the abbreviation means FPV - First Person View). This is a function of transmitting video in real time from the camera installed in the front of the UAV. The operator controls the drone using a remote control and sees the area around the drone in real time with the help of special glasses, as if he were sitting inside the drone itself, just like the pilot.</p>

                <p>This is not military equipment, such drones are used in civilian life for entertainment, for example, in sports races. They can carry a payload, while FPV drones do not have an autopilot and fly without GPS.</p>
                
                <p>Drones show exceptional maneuverability and are able to quickly change the direction of movement. This requires a high level of skill and training. Due to the fact that the operator has to manually manage all flight processes. Characteristics depend on the specific model, FPV drones can reach speeds of over 100 kilometers per hour and more.</p>
                
                <p>FPV drones in the Russian-Ukrainian war mean high-speed quadcopters controlled using a special headset.</p>

Such drones are actively used during Russia's war against Ukraine. In trained FPV hands, kamikaze drones are highly accurate weapons capable of engaging various armored vehicles and destroying enemy personnel.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">The structure of the FPV drone</h2>
                <p>FPV kamikaze drone is a complex technical system that combines various components to achieve high speed, maneuverability and precision in control. The most important components of this drone include body, motors, video camera, video transmitter, FPV glasses or monitor, controls, battery and flight controller.</p>
                <p>The body is made of light but strong materials such as carbon fiber to ensure an optimal ratio between weight and strength. High-speed motors are used to provide the powerful thrust required for fast and maneuverable flight.</p>

                <p>However, the most defining characteristic of an FPV drone is the video signal transmission system, which allows the pilot to view images from the drone's camera in real time. This includes a video camera, video transmitter and FPV goggles or monitor. The video camera has a low mass and high image quality, so that the pilot can clearly see the surrounding environment. The video transmitter transmits the signal from the camera to the FPV goggles or the pilot's monitor, providing a real-time view of the information. FPV goggles or a monitor allow the pilot to experience the flight in an immersive way, watching the actual image transmitted from the drone's camera. All these components work together to provide the pilot with a convenient and efficient way to control the drone in FPV mode.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Війна з Росією</h2>
                <p>The Ukrainian military has been actively using FPV drones almost since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. They are operated by various units of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the Security Service of Ukraine, and the Special Operations Forces, as well as soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and other units. Usually, the military operates in small groups, consisting of operators and their assistants. Sometimes FPV kamikaze or drop drones are paired with reconnaissance copters – this provides greater operational efficiency and situational awareness for operators.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>In 2022, such drones for the needs of the military began to be massively collected and purchased by various volunteer initiatives, and then private enterprises joined this process.</p>

                <figure class="figure">

                </figure>

                <p>At the front, drones fly into enemy dugouts, hatches of tanks and armored vehicles and cars with high precision.</p>
                <p>One of the great advantages of FPV drones is their price and high accuracy of use. The best models cost twice as much as the usual Mavic quadcopter. For example, a drone costing up to $1,000 is capable of carrying a charge that, in case of a successful hit, can hit and even completely destroy an enemy BMP or tank worth several million.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Production of FPV drones</h2>
                <p>At first, volunteer groups and private manufacturers used components bought mainly in China.</p>
                <p>Now the production is in full swing, and we are already talking about thousands of FPV drones per month. Manufacturers are currently working on diversifying the supply of parts and adjusting the production of individual components already in Ukraine in order to be less dependent on the foreign market.</p>
                <p>In July, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that, starting from February 2022, 28 models of UAVs of various types from Ukrainian manufacturers were adopted or put into service.</p>
                <p>"Among them, including, 9 models of kamikaze drones, including 3 of the aircraft type, as well as 6 models of FPV drones. The total number of UAVs and drones supplied to the Armed Forces of Ukraine as part of the procurement of the Ministry of Defense amounts to thousands of units," the message read.</p>
                <p>According to the agency, after the simplification of the procedure for manufacturers last fall, the period for putting new equipment into operation was shortened from two years to a few weeks.</p>
                <p>In August 2023, Yaroslav Oliynyk, adviser to the Minister of Strategic Industry, announced at the iForum conference that three domestic state-owned factories had already started production of FPV drones.</p>
                <p>He also emphasized that the Ministry of Strategprom is working for the maintenance and development of the Ukrainian UAV market, looking for ways of partnership between state and private manufacturers. In addition, the localization of production of components in Ukraine and cooperation with international investors, funds and manufacturers is carried out.</p>
                <p>"Military" gives only a few examples of FPV drone projects implemented in Ukraine.</p>
                <p>In September, the Ministry of Defense allowed the domestic FPV attack drone KH-S7 to be used in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is designed to hit various mobile and stationary ground targets.</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>The drone has been under development since the summer of last year. Like-minded people gathered in the team, including engineers and military personnel, who were previously interested in UAVs as a hobby and had been engaged in them for years.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>It is stated that the FPV drone KH-S7 normally carries a useful weight of 1 kilogram for a distance of 7 km, the power is enough for more, but there are many conditions. According to the developers, this drone was used by the Ukrainian military at a range of 9.5 kilometers. The manufacturer is now engaged in scaling up the production of drones to meet the existing needs of the Ukrainian army.</p>
            
                <p>Ukraine is also working on homing FPV drones. In particular, specialists of the AirUnit company work in this direction. The company explains that if such a system is available, the UAV operator will only need to capture the target by selecting the object on the screen, then the software will come into play.</p>
            
                <figure class="figure">

                <p>The presence of such a system solves the problem of loss of communication and the drone missing, which can happen during a dive on a target.</p>

                <p>Ukraine also develops and manufactures ammunition for dropping from FPV drones. In particular, volunteers from the "Steel Hornets" project created a special shrapnel ammunition with ready-made striking elements in the form of metal balls, designed to fight the enemy's manpower.</p>

                <p>UAV operators use the diving method to strike from the air using new munitions. This approach to application allows you to use FPV drones several times.</p>
                
                <p>In October of this year, the Cabinet of Ministers made a decision to simplify the import of materials for the production of ammunition and combat parts for UAVs as much as possible.</p>

                <p>The Russian air defense complex hit the soldiers of the company of unmanned attack aircraft complexes "ACHILLES" of the 92nd separate mechanized brigade.</p>
                 <p>Now the Ukrainian military is conducting an offensive operation around Bakhmut in order to surround the enemy forces and prevent the Russians from transferring units from here to the south.</p>

                <p>For this, in particular, FPV drones are actively used to attack the cars and armored vehicles of the Russian occupiers. In particular, the Main Directorate of Intelligence sent its kamikaze drone operators in this direction.</p>
                 <p>The Ukrainian military is also purposefully hunting down Russian drone operators in order to eliminate them.</p>
                 <p>Recently, a shock FPV drone struck a Russian tank in the Kherson region. The drone hit the engine compartment of the tank, which caused it to catch fire and stop.</p>

                <p>As a result of the hit, the tank was partially damaged, but it was taken into custody by our military. After a short-term repair of the tank engine, he joined the ranks of Ukrainian equipment on the battlefield.</p>
                 <p>Ukraine's defense forces began using FPV drones with a warhead that hits targets by detonating a high-explosive or shrapnel warhead in the air.</p>

                 <p>Upon hearing the sound of the quadcopter, the occupiers reacted in time and left the place of a potential hit, but instead of diving, the FPV drone detonated in the air directly above the Russians. Four of them were in the affected area and were probably injured.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">FPV in Russia</h2>
                 <p>Since the beginning of mass use of FPV drones at the front by the Ukrainian Defense Forces, the Russian Federation has lagged behind in this UAV segment.</p>
                 <p>However, later, the Russians launched mass production of such drones. This is connected with the infusion of large funds, which the aggressor country directed into the military-industrial complex. Mass production of such drones began in the second half of 2023. Now the Russian occupiers are able to use thousands of FPV drones at the front against Ukrainian defenders.</p>

                <p>The appearance on the front of the Russian-Ukrainian war of FPV drones that perform various combat tasks. It led to the development of this segment of flying drones that can strike equipment and manpower, both as kamikaze drones and reusable UAVs with a mechanism for dropping ammunition on a target.</p>
                 <p>They pose a great danger, which forces us to look for new approaches in the tactics of using units on the battlefield, new methods of protecting military equipment, the development of small-sized EW devices to protect an individual unit of equipment or a trench from damage by FPV drones.</p>
                 <p>Because the successful use of one or more such cheap drones leads to the reduction or disabling of any, including expensive military equipment. That there is a disproportionate amount of money spent on the production/purchase of an FPV-UAV and the cost and time for the production of a new tank or BMP.</p>
