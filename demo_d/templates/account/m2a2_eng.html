                <p>The United States sent a more advanced version of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle to Ukraine, designated the M2A2 ODS-SA.</p>
                <p>The Bradley is armed with a 25mm gun, a machine gun and a TOW anti-tank missile system.</p>
                <p>The crew of the M2 Bradley consists of three people, the BMP can carry up to six infantrymen in the landing compartment.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Externally, the M2A2 ODS-SA can be distinguished from older versions by the driver's camera in the front part of the BMP body.</p>
                <p>The M2A3 has the same camera. However, the photo of the Ukrainian BMP lacks the latest commander's sight, which indicates that the Americans did transfer the M2A2 ODS-SA.</p>
                <p>In everything else, according to the manufacturer BAE Systems, the ODS-SA version is almost identical to the M2A3 and has most of its improvements.</p>

                <p>The weight of the M2A2 ODS-SA is 34,250 kg. The machine is driven by a 600-horsepower engine. It can develop a speed of up to 61 km/h.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of June 2023, in the Zaporozhye direction, various Forces from Bradley of the newly created 47th brigade are sent to break through the Russian positions. </p>
                 <p>American armored vehicles were supposed to fire on the forest plantations where the positions of the occupiers were located. </p>
                 <p>Then the infantry had to disembark from the armored vehicles and occupy the Russian positions. </p>
                <figure class="figure" >

                </figure>
                <p>However, in the first days of the assault, armored vehicles come under heavy artillery fire and mine traps. </p>
                 <p>As a result, a significant number of Bradleys "dislodge" losing the ability to move and the crews leave them. </p>
                 <p>The Russians started working on the American armored vehicles in Zaporozhye as soon as they came within a 2-kilometer radius of the occupiers' position. </p>

                <p>The Russians continued to fire on the Bradley even as the armored vehicles moved back to their positions. </p>
                 <p>Later, when the front line was moved, these cars were evacuated. In this direction, not a single inflated Bradley falls into the hands of the Russians. </p>
                 <p>It immediately becomes clear that the armor of these armored vehicles is able to withstand blows that the Soviet BMP could not survive. </p>
                 <p>"When we were leaving for the position to evacuate the infantry, we were blown up by a mine, even if it was Soviet equipment, we would not have made it back ourselves, so we blew ourselves up, got out of the BMP and went to our base," the military said. </p>
                 <p>There were cases when the Bradley of one crew, during the battles in Zaporizhzhia, was blown up by a mine, withstood the hits of a tank, a shock FPV drone and an anti-tank complex. </p>
                 <p>"I once exploded on an anti-tank mine and there was a direct hit of a cumulative projectile on the tower. When a cumulative projectile hit the tower, the sighting devices were damaged and triplexes were broken, and only the mechanic-driver received a concussion. All other crew members and the landing party were intact," the military said.</p>

                <p>This machine is rumored from afar, but it didn't really hurt operations due to the Bradley's speed. </p>
                 <p>"Hearing it from afar, we have seen it for ourselves, but the fact that you hear it does not make it easier for the enemy, you heard it, while you raise the ATGM, while you prepare everything - it's time. During this time, Bradley will have time to do the work and leave," said the soldier.</p>
                 <p>The captured Russians said that when they heard Bradley, they tried to hide in trenches or basements. </p>
                 <p>"Not all BMP and tank crews wanted to go out on the Bradley, because it can harm them," the military said.</p>
                 <p>Bradley was very easy to destroy Russian BMPs, and thanks to the presence of the TOW anti-tank missile system, it was possible to knock out tanks.</p>

                <p>"The Russians underestimated us, they worked on us with RPGs and thought that it would take us, but it didn't work out that way," the military said.</p>
                 <p>During the assault on Robotina, everything was done in the morning. Bradley delivered and picked up infantrymen and worked for the Russians themselves.</p>
                 <p>On August 23, 2023, fighters of the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade raised the flag of Ukraine over the liberated settlement of Robotyne in Zaporizhzhia.</p>

                 <p>In the fall of 2023, the Ukrainian command will send Bradley infantry fighting vehicles to defend the Avdiiv direction.</p>
                 <p>The 47th brigade begins to hold the defense north of Avdiyivka, in the area of the village of Stepovoy, Berdychi and on the Avdiyivskoye coke farm. </p>

                 <p>In Zaporizhzhia, many kilometers of mined territory and armored vehicles were forced to move along narrow demined roads.</p>
                 <p>The Avdiiv direction turned out to be different in this regard and enabled the Bradley crews to maneuver.</p>

                <p>Bradley BMP is used as a means of fire to destroy Russian advancing forces and to transport infantry to the trenches.</p>
                 <p>"They hit enemy equipment. And APC and BMP. And the tanks were destroyed as well. The enemy is not overflowing here. They suffer huge losses.

                <p>It gets to the point that sometimes Bradleys engage in close combat with modern Russian tanks.</p>
                 <p>For example, in the area of the village of Stepove, a Bradley crew engaged in a battle with a Russian T-90 Proryv tank at a distance of no more than 150 meters.</p>
                 <p>At first, the BMP fired at the Russian tank with armor-piercing shells, then they decided to knock out the optics of the T-90M tank with high-explosive fragmentation shells.</p>
                 <p>The shell hits disabled the control system of the Russian tank.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Conclusions</h2>
                <p>American Bradley armored vehicles proved to be a very powerful support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
                <p>These BMPs are capable of withstanding hits from anti-tank weapons, detonations on mines while keeping the soldiers inside.</p>
                <p>On defense, the Bradley effectively and accurately destroys Russian infantry that try to entrench themselves in houses or forest plantations.</p>

                <p>Also, the car serves as a good means of evacuating the wounded or an armored personnel carrier for assault groups, which can immediately cover with fire.</p>
                 <p>However, if you shoot down a lightweight caterpillar on a car, the crew will be forced to leave the Bradley. After that, the enemy sometimes simply forced the Ukrainian BMP to leave the tanks.</p>
                 <p>On the Avdiiv direction, there was a case when Russian infantry with an RPG knocked out a caterpillar on a Bradley and then dragged it back to its positions.</p>
                 <p>It became the only Bradley infantry fighting vehicle that the invaders managed to capture. The car also received system damage.</p>

                <p>It is also worth noting that Ukraine uses Bradley without active protection, which could further strengthen the protection of these armored vehicles.</p>
                 <p>At the same time, at the end of 2021, the US Army has practically completed all the necessary tests for the integration of the active defense complex for Bradley.</p>
                 <p>The Americans planned to complete the testing and integration of the Iron Fist Light Decoupled defense by the end of fiscal year 2022.</p>

                <p>Iron Fist Light Decoupled launches an interceptor in the direction of an aerial threat.</p>
                 <p>The interceptor detonates next to the enemy ordnance away from the infantry fighting vehicle, minimizing damage to the vehicle.</p>
                 <p>It is not only that in the future Ukrainian Bradleys will receive this active protection, which will make these BMPs even more powerful.</p>
